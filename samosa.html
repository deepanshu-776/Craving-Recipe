       <h4> Samosas are one of India's most beloved street foods, known for their crispy, flaky pastry and a savory, spiced potato and pea filling. The secret to a great samosa is in the balance—a firm, non-greasy dough, a flavorful filling, and a proper frying technique. Here is a comprehensive guide to making the best samosas at home.

<p><br></p>

<div class="instructions">
Part 1:The Samosa Dough (Patti) <br>
The dough is the most crucial part. A perfect samosa dough is firm, not soft, and creates a flaky, blister-free crust when fried.
<p><br></p>
<p class="ingridient">
Ingredients:<br>

gredients for Samosa Dough:<br>

All-Purpose Flour (Maida): 2 cups<br>

Ghee (Clarified Butter) or Oil: ¼ cup (or about 4 tablespoons)<br>

Carom Seeds (Ajwain): ¾ teaspoon (optional, but adds a traditional flavor and helps with digestion)<br>

Salt: ¾ teaspoon<br>

Water: 6 tablespoons, or as needed
<br></p>
<p><br></p>



<p><br></p>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
1.Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, salt, and carom seeds.
<p><br></p>
2.Add Fat: Add the ghee or oil to the flour mixture. Using your fingertips, rub the fat into the flour. This is a crucial step for achieving a flaky texture. Continue rubbing until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs and clumps together when you press a handful in your palm.
<p><br></p>
3. Knead the Dough: Slowly add water, one tablespoon at a time, and knead until the dough comes together. The dough should be firm and stiff, not soft or sticky like bread dough. Do not over-knead it. A firm dough is the key to a crispy samosa
<p><br></p>
4.Rest the Dough: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll.

Part 2:The Potato Masala Filling (Aloo Masala)<br>
This is the classic filling for a samosa.
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="ingridient">
Ingredients:<br>
Potatoes: 3-4 medium-sized potatoes, boiled, peeled, and crumbled or roughly mashed<br>

Green Peas: ½ cup (fresh or frozen)<br>

Oil: 2 tablespoons<br>

Cumin Seeds (Jeera): 1 teaspoon<br>

Fennel Seeds (Saunf): ½ teaspoon<br>

Coriander Seeds (Dhania): 1 teaspoon, lightly crushed<br>

Ginger: 1-inch piece, grated or finely chopped<br>

Green Chilies: 1-2, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference)<br>

Red Chili Powder: ½ teaspoon<br>

Turmeric Powder: ¼ teaspoon<br>

Garam Masala: 1 teaspoon<br>

Dried Mango Powder (Amchur): 1 teaspoon (for a tangy flavor)<br>

Fresh Coriander Leaves: 2 tablespoons, chopped<br>

Salt: To taste<br></p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="extra">
    <br>
    Instructions for Making the Filling:<br>

1.Boil Potatoes and Peas: Boil the potatoes until they are just cooked through and firm, not mushy. Also, boil the peas or use frozen peas directly in the pan. Drain the potatoes and let them cool completely before roughly mashing them.<br>

2.Temper the Spices: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, fennel seeds, and crushed coriander seeds. Let them splutter and become fragrant.<br>

3.Sauté Aromatics: Add the ginger and green chilies. Sauté for a minute.<br>

4.Add Potatoes and Spices: Add the roughly mashed potatoes and green peas to the pan. Sprinkle with red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, amchur, and salt.<br>

5.Mix and Cool: Mix everything well and cook on low heat for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to combine. Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped fresh coriander. Let the filling cool completely before you begin shaping the samosas.<br>

Instructions: for shaping and frying the samosas<br>
1.Roll the Dough: Take a small portion of the rested dough and roll it into a smooth ball. On a clean surface, roll it into an oval shape about 6-7 inches long. Do not use any flour while rolling; the dough should be firm enough not to stick.
<p><br></p>
2.Cut and Shape the Cone: Cut the oval in half to create two semi-circles. Take one semi-circle and apply a little water along the straight edge. Bring the two corners of the straight edge together, overlapping them slightly, to form a cone. Pinch the seam firmly to seal it.
<p><br></p>
3.Fill the Samosa: Hold the cone in your hand and fill it with about 2-3 tablespoons of the cooled potato filling, making sure not to overfill.
<p><br></p>
4.Pinch and Seal: Apply a little water to the inside of the open edge. Fold one side of the back of the dough into a pleat and press the two open edges together to create a sealed triangle. Pinch the top and bottom edges firmly to ensure no filling leaks out.
<p><br></p>
5.Frying: Heat oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan on a low flame. The oil should be warm, not hot. Add a few samosas to the oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.
<p><br></p>
6.Slow Frying: Fry the samosas on low heat. This slow frying process is essential for a crispy, flaky crust and ensures the dough cooks through. After 8-10 minutes, the samosas will start to become firm and turn a light golden color.
<p><br></p>
7.Increase Heat: Once they are a light golden color, increase the heat to medium and continue frying until they are a deep, even golden brown.
<p><br></p>
8.Drain and Serve: Carefully remove the samosas with a slotted spoon and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
