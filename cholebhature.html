<div class="instructions">
Part 1: Chole (Spicy Chickpea Curry)<br>
This recipe uses whole spices and a unique technique to get a rich, dark color and complex flavor.
<p><br></p>
<p class="ingridient">
Ingredients:<br>

1 cup dried chickpeas (chole), soaked overnight
<br>
1 large onion, finely chopped
<br>
2 medium tomatoes, pureed
<br>
1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
<br>
1 green chili, slit
<br>
For the Spice Pouch (Potli Masala):
<br>
1 black cardamom
<br>
2 cloves
<br>
2 green cardamoms
<br>
1 cinnamon stick (1 inch)
<br>
2 bay leaves
<br>
1 tsp tea leaves (for color)
<br>
1/2 tsp salt
<br>
Dry Spices:
<br>
1 tsp coriander powder
<br>
1/2 tsp cumin powder
<br>
1 tsp chole masala (or garam masala)
<br>
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
<br>
1/2 tsp red chili powder
<br>
Salt to taste
<br>
2 tbsp oil or ghee
<br>
Fresh coriander for garnish
<br>
1 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crushed<br></p>
<p><br></p>



<p><br></p>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
1.Boil the Chickpeas: Drain the soaked chickpeas. In a pressure cooker, add the chickpeas, enough water to cover them, and the spice pouch (wrapped in a small piece of muslin cloth). Cook for 5-6 whistles or until the chickpeas are very soft and mushy. Discard the spice pouch.
<p><br></p>
2.Prepare the Gravy: Heat oil or ghee in a pan. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they are golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chili, and cook for a minute until the raw aroma disappears.
<p><br></p>
3.Cook the Tomatoes: Add the tomato puree and all the dry spices (coriander, cumin, chole masala, turmeric, red chili powder). Cook the mixture on low heat until the oil separates from the masala.
<p><br></p>
4.Combine and Simmer: Add the boiled chickpeas to the pan, along with some of the cooking water from the pressure cooker to adjust the consistency. Add salt and mix well. Bring to a boil, then simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes, mashing a few chickpeas to thicken the gravy.
<p><br></p>
5.Finish the Chole: Crush the kasuri methi between your palms and add it to the chole. Garnish with fresh coriander.

Part 2:Bhature (Leavened Fried Bread)<br>
The secret to soft, fluffy bhature is in the dough's fermentation.
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="ingridient">
Ingredients:<br>
2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)<br>

1/2 cup semolina (sooji), fine<br>

1/2 tsp baking powder<br>

1/4 tsp baking soda<br>

1 tsp sugar<br>

1/2 tsp salt<br>

1/4 cup plain yogurt (dahi)<br>

1 tbsp oil<br>

Warm water, as needed for kneading<br>

Oil for deep frying<br></p>
<p><br></p>

Instructions:
1.Mix the Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the flour, semolina, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.
<p><br></p>
2.Make the Dough: Add the yogurt and oil to the flour mixture. Mix everything well. Gradually add warm water and knead the mixture into a soft, smooth, and slightly sticky dough. Knead for at least 10-15 minutes.
<p><br></p>
3.Ferment the Dough: Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm place for at least 2-3 hours. For the best results, let it ferment for 6-8 hours or overnight. The dough should double in size.
<p><br></p>
4.Prepare for Frying: Punch down the dough to release the air. Divide it into small balls. Gently flatten each ball and roll it into an oval or circular shape (about 4-5 inches in diameter).
<p><br></p>
5.Fry the Bhature: Heat oil for deep-frying in a kadhai or wok. The oil should be very hot. Gently slide a rolled bhatura into the hot oil. Using a slotted spoon, lightly press down on the center of the bhatura to help it puff up. Flip it and fry the other side until it's golden brown.
<p><br></p>
6.Serve: Remove the bhatura from the oil and place it on a paper towel to drain excess oil. Serve immediately with the hot chole.
