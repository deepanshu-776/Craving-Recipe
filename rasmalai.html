       <h4> Ras malai is a classic Indian dessert known for its soft, spongy paneer discs soaked in a rich, creamy, and fragrant milk syrup. While many recipes exist, a "best" one typically focuses on two key things: getting the softest, most porous paneer discs and a perfectly balanced rabri (thickened milk).

Here is a comprehensive recipe that combines the best practices for both components.</h4>
<p><br></p>

<div class="instructions">
Part 1: Making the Rasgulla (Paneer Discs)<br>
This is the most critical part of the recipe for achieving a soft texture.
<p><br></p>
<p class="ingridient">
Ingredients:,<br>

1 liter full-fat cow's milk<br>

2-3 tbsp lemon juice or white vinegar (or 1/4 cup plain yogurt)<br>

1 tbsp cornflour or all-purpose flour<br>

1 cup sugar<br>

4 cups water<br></p>
<p><br></p>



<p><br></p>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
1.Curdle the Milk: Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Once it boils, turn off the heat. Wait for 2-3 minutes to let the temperature drop slightly. Slowly add the lemon juice or vinegar, stirring gently. The milk will begin to curdle. Stop adding the acid once the whey (the watery, greenish liquid) separates from the paneer solids (chenna).
<p><br></p>
2.Strain and Wash the Chenna: Line a colander with a muslin or cheesecloth. Pour the curdled milk into the colander to strain out the whey. Immediately rinse the chenna under cold running water to wash away any sourness from the lemon juice.
<p><br></p>
3.Squeeze Out Excess Water: Gather the corners of the muslin cloth and squeeze out all the excess water. The goal is to get the chenna moist but not dripping wet. Hang it for about 30 minutes to ensure all the water has drained.
<p><br></p>
4.Knead the Chenna: Place the drained chenna on a large plate or a clean surface. Knead it with the heel of your palm for about 10 minutes until it becomes completely smooth and free of any grains. It should resemble a smooth dough.
<p><br></p>
5.Form the Rasgullas: Add the cornflour to the kneaded chenna and knead for another 2-3 minutes. This will bind the chenna together and prevent the discs from breaking. Divide the dough into 12-15 equal parts. Roll each part into a smooth, crack-free ball and then gently flatten it into a disc.
<p><br></p>
6.Prepare the Sugar Syrup: In a large, wide pan, bring 4 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar to a rolling boil.
<p><br></p>
7.Cook the Rasgullas: Gently drop the flattened discs into the boiling sugar syrup. Cover the pan and cook on high heat for 10-15 minutes. The rasgullas will double in size and become spongy.
<p><br></p>
8.Cool and Squeeze: Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the rasgullas cool down in the syrup. Once they are at room temperature, take each disc and gently squeeze out the excess sugar syrup. Be careful not to press too hard or they may break.

Part 2: Making the Rabri (Sweetened Milk Syrup)<br>
This is what gives Ras malai its signature flavor.
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="ingridient">
Ingredients:<br>

1 liter full-fat milk<br>

1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)<br>

1/2 tsp cardamom powder<br>

A pinch of saffron strands (kesar)<br>

1 tbsp sliced pistachios and almonds<br>

1/2 tsp rose water or kewra water (optional)<br></p>
<p><br></p>

Instructions:
1.Reduce the Milk: In a thick-bottomed pan, bring 1 liter of milk to a boil over medium heat.
<p><br></p>
2.Simmer and Scrape: Lower the heat and let the milk simmer. As a layer of cream (malai) forms on top, use a spatula to scrape it from the sides and stir it back into the milk. This process is key to thickening the milk and giving it a rich texture. Continue simmering and scraping until the milk has reduced to roughly half its original volume.
<p><br></p>
3.Add Flavor and Sweetness: Add the sugar, cardamom powder, and saffron strands to the reduced milk. Stir until the sugar has dissolved.
<p><br></p>
4.Final Touches: Add most of the sliced pistachios and almonds, reserving some for garnish. Stir well. Turn off the heat and add the rose water or kewra water for a beautiful floral aroma.
<p><br></p>
5.Assemble the Ras malai: Gently place the squeezed paneer discs into the prepared warm rabri.
<p><br></p>
6.Chill and Serve: Cover the bowl and let the Ras malai cool down completely. For the best flavor, chill it in the refrigerator for at least 4-5 hours or overnight.
